Money has actually many, many different implications to it because everybody wants more money, but the question is why do you want more money?"

He's also started nine different companies. He's currently the co-founder and CEO of The Rewired Group. This is Bob's second visit to the podcast. In our first conversation, we got super deep on the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. In this conversation, we talk about his new book that he believes is going to be even more impactful to the world than the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. The book is called Job Moves. It's basically a very tactical guide to finding a job that you love. I won't give it away, but if you're struggling to find a job or hate the job that you are currently in and aren't sure what to do, or you want to get better at hiring and keeping amazing people,"

They're not sure what to do about it. Or on the flip side, they're trying to hire amazing people or keep amazing people and they're having a hard time doing that. And luckily you just wrote a new book called Job Moves that I have right here that has a very different set of advice and different perspective on how to approach these problems. And if I may, the job to be done of this episode is to help people find a job that they love, find a better job, decide when to leave a job and hire and keep amazing people. How's that sound?"

And talent was always on that list. And to be honest, I really didn't want to go into the space because it's just so... I don't know, to me it was icky, but at the same time, the reality is I realized there's just a lot of struggling moments around it and for me and what I do, I just love to help struggling moments. And so it started out almost 15 years ago working with Ethan Bernstein, who's a business school professor at Harvard in the organizational behavior side. And basically, he saw me do an interview around jobs for a product and said, \"Well, boy, I think we should think about this for...\""

We've built a class around it and it's one of those things that I've become... Like I went down the rabbit hole and I couldn't get out. And so it's very, very exciting. And to be honest, the book launched in November and I think that ultimately I'll be remembered more for this book than Jobs-to-be-Done because I think there's a billion people a year who switch jobs and ultimately most of them end up with a job that's worse than the one they were at,"

Let's say there's a hundred thousand people who need to know Jobs-to-be-Done. There are a billion people every year who actually need to know how to find their next job. And so to me,"

      "speaker": "Yeah. And it also helps people hiring. So the TAM is even larger.\n\nBob Moesta",

      "content": "The thing that I've learned though is that Jobs-to-be-Done is a very powerful concept, but the reality is I think it's actually more beneficial when you apply it to things. So I've applied it to sales, I've applied it to college, I've applied it to careers, and so part of it is figuring out where to apply it next. And so I have other places that I'm working on,"

      "speaker": "but the reality is I think jobs is so powerful that it will just help recreate categories.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

      "content": "The number one thing we heard that when you do these interviews is the first thing they say, \"Well, tell me about your new job.\" They go like, \"Oh my God, I got so lucky.\" They just attributed it all to luck. And ultimately luck is when opportunity meets preparedness. And so you start to realize that when you start to interview people about the luck, it turns out that there was things that happened to them that made them ready to see the opportunity. And there's other things where actually their experiences actually shaped what they were looking for and so they could see the opportunity. And so you started to realize this is a much bigger thing around that employees hire companies more than companies hire employees. That's really the big thing. And if that's the case, how do I prepare you as an employee to know how to hire your job every single day, wherever you're at, how do you make sure you're doing the things you want to do and you're making progress in your life?"

      "content": "Well, it's very similar to product. There's difference between product features and product experiences. And what you start to realize is that the experiences that keep you at your job and the good experiences and bad experiences are the things that actually pull it together, which is how attributes work through time and space. And so ultimately you want people to realize it's not just about the money, it's about is the money actually... Do they give you more money for a sign of respect? Because you start to realize when we did this, you'd unpack money. Money is a surrogate for respect or I've got bills to pay or I'm falling behind, or the fact is I deserve more. And so it comes back to money has actually many, many different implications to it and it's getting people to know why they want more money. Because everybody wants more money, but the question is why do you want more money?"

      "timestamp_seconds": 0.0,
      "content": "So to me it's about actually understanding the experiences because you start to realize there's a concept we talk about and we'll probably get to about energy drivers and energy drains. So think of moments where you actually go into a situation and you get energy from it. Well, that's an experience that's not an attribute. At the same time, the fact this is those moments where you go in and you get the life sucked out of you, that's an experience. And so part of it is helping people understand the experiences they want so they can be successful,"

And so these are unfiltered interviews around like tell me what was really going on and out of it, we end up getting what we call pushes and pulls and these pushes and pulls is we end up with 13 different pushes. Things like I'm bored, things like I'm pushed beyond my ability, I've been disrespected. There's these things that have to happen that cause them to do that. There's also 14"

      "content": "There's these other things that you pull for. But what happened is that when you start to look at all thousand interviews, they fall into one of four buckets. Two of them really are the standard thing. One is this bucket of get out. It is sucking my energy. I don't really know what to do, I can't think about what to do next. Help me get out of here so I can actually start to breathe and think. Right? Another quest is help me take the next step, which is I am where I am. The fact is I don't see a place where I can go next. And the fact is I want to take the next step to build some skills or capabilities, help me find that place where I can take my next step. Those are two standard ones,"

      "content": "This is where you like what you're doing, but the fact is that at some point there's just too much of it and you're not doing it in a way that basically you don't like the way you're doing it. And so part of it is pulling you back to basically where you actually have control over the work and control over yourself and control to basically manage your time yourself because at some point we get sucked in and it happens a lot in startups. It gets to be so much it's like, all right, I need to get control because my home life is falling apart. There's things like that and I can speak from experience on that where I've actually sold out of a startup so I could actually go back and fix my home life. There's the fourth one though is a very interesting one, which is when you're in a position and you start to end up... You end getting stretched into other places where you're not necessarily so good, but the fact is it is part of the experience,"

I really like to do that stuff. I had this one, for example, I grew my firm where I had almost 50"

So how many people say they want a new job, but they actually don't know what to do?"

And so it's this notion of it's not anyone push, but it's when the set of pushes come together and really give you enough energy to go like, yeah, I can't see where to go. I am disrespected. And the fact is I'm not learning as much as I used to learn, I got to go find a new place. And so it's these three or four things that have to happen that ultimately cause people to say,"

So we have to talk about the polls, which are these things that happen to you that the outcomes that you're actually seeking by going to this job. And it's not more money. Like 53% of the people who basically said they got more money, did not get more money. They told the company they had more money because they knew they couldn't argue with having them come back because they got more money.

So it's like I don't want to intimidate people by nine steps, but the reality is this is a really big one, which is to go back through your career and even back to college, I've taken people back to high school and basically talk about those moments where you got energy, you walked into a situation and you literally were like, \"Oh my God, I got so excited about this and =why did I get excited?\" (00:18:16): It's one, capturing those moments and then dissecting those moments to say, what was it about that context that gave you energy that made you excited, right? For me, it was like, oh, learning something new. I get really excited by learning new things. And so it's like, okay, and what I realized is that when I actually know something, I actually get bored with it. It actually sucks my energy because then I got to prove myself to everybody else as opposed to trying to learn something new. The other half is these energy drains, which is this aspect of the things that you go in and just suck the life out of you.

And what I realized is that if you can pull that ratio to 40% energy drive or drain or 50 50, you don't even know you're working anymore because you're just used to basically always doing the grind to get where you want to go. And so part of this is to realize that it's about reducing stress as well, but energy drivers and drains are these things that most people have, they need some help remembering. And what I've learned is that I can interview somebody about, so tell me about this last job. Tell me about one of the greatest moments you had at that job.

And so it's this reflective nature of pulling out those things that give you energy because if you're in a place that gives you energy, again, it doesn't feel like you're working.

But what I've learned is if I wrap a process around something I love to do, I actually ruin it. But if I wrap a process about something I really hate to do and gamify it, I can actually get through it. And so lots of times you start to realize there's these little tricks you learn along the way that help you do that. But I would say paying attention in your day-to-day life about just reflect on the day and say, where did I get energy today and where did my energy get drained?

Is there any way we can think about where I get more of the stuff I can do versus the stuff that I really suck at? And most people don't want to say it, but when they actually do it's amazing because people go like, oh yeah, I get that. Okay, we can actually give this off to somebody else. It's crazy.

And you start to realize I can change the design of the job and now they love what they do, they're never going to leave. And so you start to realize it's about actually understanding how to do that, which is I think really, really powerful.

So it's this notion of, again, action as opposed to most features are static, so what does it actually do for you? And what happens through time is that title will wear down over time. And so it has a depreciation to it that now I've been a VP, now I got to be a C-level person.

And so ultimately a lot of this starts when they can't see where they can grow and go. And so it starts to realize, and that's where a lot of this starts.

How do we prototype different job positions for you? So how do we think of you? So I was talking to somebody or I was coaching somebody who was a neuroscientist and they had just come back from Ireland and they were running this big lab and they got burnt out and they came and basically took a job at a hospital. And as she started to talk about what gave her energy and not, we said, well, what about being a design researcher? What about being a National Geographic coordinator?"

And so you'd think, boy, if I'm in finance or I'm in marketing in a financial corporation, oh I got to find another financial company. But if you're good at marketing and you like what you do, you can go to a lot of different places. And so it's this notion of starting by doing what we call informational interviews to other jobs that are out there. So it's like I was coaching somebody and I said, all we're this person that was the neuroscientist. It's like, all right, we're going to go find somebody who's in that geo coordinator, we're going to go to LinkedIn and find somebody who either had the job or has the job and you're going to interview them to say, \"What's it like to have this job?\" (00:32:42): And this does two things. It gives you practice talking about yourself and talking to other people, which most people haven't done in a long time. And the other part is it allows you to start to put yourself in that situation and go like, well, this really worked for me or not. And it turned out the fact is she was thinking she could travel and she could do science and she could help people be a teacher. And it turns out that geo coordinator is just like a travel agent. It literally, it's all pre-programmed and everything else. And she's like, \"Oh, I'm out.\" And so it is helping them actually put the rubber to the road on some of these notions because most people start applying for jobs, but they really don't know what they are. And so what I would tell you is one is as somebody looking for a job is distill your skills, distill what gives you energy,"

And so the question is, and it was like 200 and which one do you want? And he ended up taking the job with the entrepreneur to teach him, but he actually went in and said, I'm taking this job, I have this other job for this other money. I'm giving up this much money so I can learn from you. And he said, fine, I'll make you chief of staff. And ultimately he said, and you're here for two years so you can be a founder.

They do what they're told as opposed to do what they should do. And so you start to realize that money has a very interesting impact on behavior, and I have not studied it in any great fashion. There's many people who have studied more than me, but that observation of when I overpay people, they're all about, I just don't want to not get my bonus and you better make sure that I can.

And so when you go into, so the first thing is when you go to interview, you actually have now done 10 to 15 interviews with informational interviews with complete strangers that make you way more comfortable with doing interviews about a job.

The other part is to realize when you find a job you want, you interview people who have those jobs and you say what was on your resume?

Every day he was so curious about everything that he did, but at the same time he really struggled to bake it in school. And one day he basically realized that his superpower was asking questions.

They have to be able to tell me their past couple jobs of what's going on.

I know that there's a legal part of all this. You got to think about marketing to people who want to do this. And so my whole thing is most people wait for people to raise their hand.

And so to me, the people who are recruiting who have read this basically have used it to say, use the forces for example, to say, why are you leaving your job? What's going on? And then ultimately, what are you looking for in the next job? And so they can use the pushes and pulls as a way to start the conversation around the interview process. Right? (01:08:56): So there's a lot of different ways where this can be put in, but let's be clear, I wrote this, we wrote this, Michael Horn and Ethan Bernstein and I, we wrote this with the intent of helping employees hire companies. And ultimately we have a lot of companies coming back to us and saying, help us fix the way we recruit, help us fix the way we write job descriptions, help us with the way in which we do performance reviews.

What this to me is a sign that you're lazy because you're saying, oh, you need to have five years experience. For an entry entry-level job, how does that work? What do you really need to know?

I was literally like, come on, this is not what I want to do. This is, and there's just so many things pulling on me and pressing on me that I'm like, okay. And I like, you know what? I'm going to go take the test. So when job moves, there's some resources and there's a test you can take and it'll tell you which quest you're in. So it asks, you pushes and pulls and puts it together and then tells you the probability that you're in one of the four quests. And as I did it, I went through it and just said, this is where I'm at, this what's going on? This is what's pushing me, this what's pulling me, where should I go next? (01:17:46): And it says, you need to have realignment. So basically it was a realignment job and I realized, okay, what are the five things that are really pulling me out of alignment? It was like all these podcasts I had to do. I wasn't building product, I was promoting more. I was doing all these things that I had to figure out how to sell books to big companies, all this stuff that just isn't me. And I realized, screw it. I'm going to buy the books. I'm going to give them away. I'm going to do, I was able to actually look at that list and pull the things off my list and basically either not do them or delegate them to somebody else. And it was actually about me pulling myself back into alignment. So I actually had more energy, and to be honest, I woke up the next day,"

And it's helped me stop the energy that's pulling me in one direction or another and helps me stay on track. And it's just a really cool tool to do that. And so I have a couple of colleagues who are doing it as well, and it just is interesting how they realize I'm not a very good delegator, but when I realized it affects my motivation this way, it's like all of a sudden I've become a way better delegator to say,"

  "full_text": "Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nYou just wrote a new book called Job Moves that I have right here. What's the big idea behind this book?\n\nBob Moesta (00:00:04):\nThe moment you stop making progress in your career is the moment you start looking for another job. And so over the last 15 years we've interviewed over a thousand people. I've coached almost a thousand people because I think there's a billion people a year who switched jobs and ultimately most of them end up with a job that's worse than the one they were at, but they don't know how to find it. They don't know themselves well enough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nThere's a very tactical piece of advice in your book, which is they do have a jobcation.\n\nBob Moesta (00:00:27):\nWhen you're in a startup, it changes who you are and the moment that you get out of that environment, you need to take the time to reset your mind and your body. I call it a jobcation, which is a job I can go do with one hand tie by hide my back so I can rest and recover to go do something else. It's about actually being able to go to the gym and work out and have some vacations. The moment you are comfortable doing nothing, you know who you are again, and you can actually figure this out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):\nYou have this really interesting distinction in the book between job features like salary and title and job experiences.\n\nBob Moesta (00:00:57):\nIt's very simple, very similar to product. There's difference between product features and product experiences, and what you start to realize is it's the experiences that keep you at your job. It's not just about the money because you start to realize money is a surrogate for respect, or I've got bills to pay or I'm falling behind. Money has actually many, many different implications to it because everybody wants more money, but the question is why do you want more money?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:22):\nToday my guest is Bob Moesta. Bob is the co-creator of the Jobs-to-be-Done Framework and worked alongside Clay Christensen for many years. He's also started nine different companies. He's currently the co-founder and CEO of The Rewired Group. This is Bob's second visit to the podcast. In our first conversation, we got super deep on the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. In this conversation, we talk about his new book that he believes is going to be even more impactful to the world than the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. The book is called Job Moves. It's basically a very tactical guide to finding a job that you love. I won't give it away, but if you're struggling to find a job or hate the job that you are currently in and aren't sure what to do, or you want to get better at hiring and keeping amazing people, this episode is for you.\n\n(00:02:06):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Bob Moesta.\n\n(00:02:20):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments, easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze all on my own.\n\n(00:03:00):\nEppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel.

So we started Vanta in 2018, focused on founders helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC II or ISO 2701. Today we currently help over 9,000 companies including some start-up household names like Atlassian, Ramp, and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:30):\nThat is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:04:36):\nThat is very much our experience, but before the company and some extent during it, but the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company, so you don't have to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:52):\nWe appreciate you for doing that and you have a special discount for listeners, they can get a $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:05:06):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:10):\nBob, thank you so much for being here and welcome back to the podcast.\n\nBob Moesta (00:05:14):\nYeah, Lenny, thanks for having me back on. I'm excited to be here and excited to share.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:18):\nThe reason I'm excited to have you back on the podcast is because I've heard from so many listeners that they're either struggling to find a job in this market or hate the job that they're in. They're not sure what to do about it. Or on the flip side, they're trying to hire amazing people or keep amazing people and they're having a hard time doing that. And luckily you just wrote a new book called Job Moves that I have right here that has a very different set of advice and different perspective on how to approach these problems. And if I may, the job to be done of this episode is to help people find a job that they love, find a better job, decide when to leave a job and hire and keep amazing people. How's that sound?\n\nBob Moesta (00:06:00):\nYeah. The premise of this was I've been asking founders for 15 years, what are the top three things that you really... If you could wave a magic wand and solve, what would it be? And talent was always on that list. And to be honest, I really didn't want to go into the space because it's just so... I don't know, to me it was icky, but at the same time, the reality is I realized there's just a lot of struggling moments around it and for me and what I do, I just love to help struggling moments. And so it started out almost 15 years ago working with Ethan Bernstein, who's a business school professor at Harvard in the organizational behavior side. And basically, he saw me do an interview around jobs for a product and said, \"Well, boy, I think we should think about this for...\" Because I'm giving advice to students about what they should do in their next career or their next job.\n\n(00:06:48):\nAnd he's like, \"Could we modify this?\" And so over the last 15 years we've interviewed over a thousand people. I've coached almost a thousand people. We've built a class around it and it's one of those things that I've become... Like I went down the rabbit hole and I couldn't get out. And so it's very, very exciting. And to be honest, the book launched in November and I think that ultimately I'll be remembered more for this book than Jobs-to-be-Done because I think there's a billion people a year who switch jobs and ultimately most of them end up with a job that's worse than the one they were at, but they don't know how to find it and part of it is they don't know themselves well enough. And so I've just learned so much and I'm excited to be here to share all the little insights that I've learned along the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:29):\nI was going to say that there's a high bar you have to hit for this to be more impactful than Jobs-to-be-Done. I love that you believe it will be.\n\nBob Moesta (00:07:38):\nOh, yeah. Well, I think there's only a small group. I actually think your audience really appreciates Jobs-to-be-Done, but I think the fact is that there's only... Let's say there's a hundred thousand people who need to know Jobs-to-be-Done. There are a billion people every year who actually need to know how to find their next job. And so to me, it's just a much bigger market. And so that's why I think I'll have more impact on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:58):\nYeah. And it also helps people hiring. So the TAM is even larger.\n\nBob Moesta (00:08:02):\nThe thing that I've learned though is that Jobs-to-be-Done is a very powerful concept, but the reality is I think it's actually more beneficial when you apply it to things. So I've applied it to sales, I've applied it to college, I've applied it to careers, and so part of it is figuring out where to apply it next. And so I have other places that I'm working on, but the reality is I think jobs is so powerful that it will just help recreate categories.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:26):\nOkay. So before I get into specific questions and tactics that you share in the book, what's just the big idea behind this book and that would be helpful for people to understand as we get into the tactics?\n\nBob Moesta (00:08:37):\nThe number one thing we heard that when you do these interviews is the first thing they say, \"Well, tell me about your new job.\" They go like, \"Oh my God, I got so lucky.\" They just attributed it all to luck. And ultimately luck is when opportunity meets preparedness. And so you start to realize that when you start to interview people about the luck, it turns out that there was things that happened to them that made them ready to see the opportunity. And there's other things where actually their experiences actually shaped what they were looking for and so they could see the opportunity. And so you started to realize this is a much bigger thing around that employees hire companies more than companies hire employees. That's really the big thing. And if that's the case, how do I prepare you as an employee to know how to hire your job every single day, wherever you're at, how do you make sure you're doing the things you want to do and you're making progress in your life? Because the moment you stop making progress in your career is the moment you start looking for another job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:31):\nOkay. And we're going to talk about the four quests of the jobs people have and all that stuff. But I want to get into something very specific and see where this conversation goes with that. And this is starting from a perspective of someone looking for a job and struggling to find a job. You have this really interesting distinction in the book between job features like salary and title and job experiences.\n\nBob Moesta (00:09:54):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:54):\nTalk about what that is and why that's so important to understand.\n\nBob Moesta (00:09:56):\nWell, it's very similar to product. There's difference between product features and product experiences. And what you start to realize is that the experiences that keep you at your job and the good experiences and bad experiences are the things that actually pull it together, which is how attributes work through time and space. And so ultimately you want people to realize it's not just about the money, it's about is the money actually... Do they give you more money for a sign of respect? Because you start to realize when we did this, you'd unpack money. Money is a surrogate for respect or I've got bills to pay or I'm falling behind, or the fact is I deserve more. And so it comes back to money has actually many, many different implications to it and it's getting people to know why they want more money. Because everybody wants more money, but the question is why do you want more money? And that's really that understanding there.\n\n(00:10:48):\nSo to me it's about actually understanding the experiences because you start to realize there's a concept we talk about and we'll probably get to about energy drivers and energy drains. So think of moments where you actually go into a situation and you get energy from it. Well, that's an experience that's not an attribute. At the same time, the fact this is those moments where you go in and you get the life sucked out of you, that's an experience. And so part of it is helping people understand the experiences they want so they can be successful, not the features.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:16):\nSo let's follow that thread of experiences, and this is a good segue to the four reasons people leave jobs and the quest as you described. So talk about what these experiences might be that you should be thinking about.\n\nBob Moesta (00:11:25):\nWhat we do is we do these interviews and we basically think of it as the ultimate of exit interviews. Why did you really leave this job? And so most of the time people won't tell their companies the truth. And so these are unfiltered interviews around like tell me what was really going on and out of it, we end up getting what we call pushes and pulls and these pushes and pulls is we end up with 13 different pushes. Things like I'm bored, things like I'm pushed beyond my ability, I've been disrespected. There's these things that have to happen that cause them to do that. There's also 14 pulls which is I want to work with a team that's got my back. I want to feel like I'm doing my best work. I want to make sure that I can free up time so I can carry my weight at home.\n\n(00:12:09):\nThere's these other things that you pull for. But what happened is that when you start to look at all thousand interviews, they fall into one of four buckets. Two of them really are the standard thing. One is this bucket of get out. It is sucking my energy. I don't really know what to do, I can't think about what to do next. Help me get out of here so I can actually start to breathe and think. Right? Another quest is help me take the next step, which is I am where I am. The fact is I don't see a place where I can go next. And the fact is I want to take the next step to build some skills or capabilities, help me find that place where I can take my next step. Those are two standard ones, but what you start to realize is there's two others and the others are basically help me regain control.\n\n(00:12:51):\nThis is where you like what you're doing, but the fact is that at some point there's just too much of it and you're not doing it in a way that basically you don't like the way you're doing it. And so part of it is pulling you back to basically where you actually have control over the work and control over yourself and control to basically manage your time yourself because at some point we get sucked in and it happens a lot in startups. It gets to be so much it's like, all right, I need to get control because my home life is falling apart. There's things like that and I can speak from experience on that where I've actually sold out of a startup so I could actually go back and fix my home life. There's the fourth one though is a very interesting one, which is when you're in a position and you start to end up... You end getting stretched into other places where you're not necessarily so good, but the fact is it is part of the experience, but you need to be realigned.\n\n(00:13:39):\nIt's like help me realign back to the things that I'm really good at and what I like to do. And so ultimately you go into a position, you get a promotion, you end up moving to a place where you can see where it's there and all of a sudden you end up waking up one morning and going like, God, why am I doing all this stuff? I really like to do that stuff. I had this one, for example, I grew my firm where I had almost 50 people and I started to realize I spent all my time on people issues and I love to work on product. And so eventually I actually reshaped the whole business to get us down to five people.\n\n(00:14:12):\nI found everybody else jobs and then ultimately helped me basically get back to being able to do the work because that's the stuff I love to do. And so it's these four different quests that you realize. And what's interesting is if I look through my career, I've been in all four of those quests sometime in my life, and part of it is to assess your situation so you understand what quest you're on so you can actually start to understand what it's going to take to make the move that you need to make.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:39):\nThat was the beginning of the question I was about to ask, which is why this is so important. So why does someone need to spend time understanding what is pulling them to get out to leave?\n\nBob Moesta (00:14:49):\nIf I go back to Jobs to Done theory, its value is created by the context that you're in and the outcome that you want and you start to realize that through your life, your context changes. And so at some point, for example, in my twenties, I'd love to learn a lot of things. And so it was this whole notion of learning lots of things. But once I mastered it was like, all right, I know all these things. What can I do next? And so you start to realize that it's about that.\n\n(00:15:13):\nWhere are you in this world and why is it creating that space for you to go like, \"Yeah, what else can I do?\" And what I would say is nobody randomly changes jobs, it's just not possible. And so the reality is you can describe it that way and most people would say Lucky is random, but the reality is it's caused and if it's now caused, you start to actually realize that context has a lot of impact in it because if I don't have enough context, I don't have enough pushes, I can complain about my job, but I'll never make the switch. So how many people say they want a new job, but they actually don't know what to do?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:46):\nSo many people talk about I out of here, I've got to leave, I got to go. And then they never do. That's\n\nBob Moesta (00:15:51):\nRight. And so what you start to realize is I have four kids and my daughter would come home one day and I'd say, how is work? And if she could name me four of the pushes, I knew she was already looking for another job. And so it's this notion of it's not anyone push, but it's when the set of pushes come together and really give you enough energy to go like, yeah, I can't see where to go. I am disrespected. And the fact is I'm not learning as much as I used to learn, I got to go find a new place. And so it's these three or four things that have to happen that ultimately cause people to say, today's the day I got to leave. But the other part is they won't leave if they don't know where to go.\n\n(00:16:30):\nAnd so a lot of people end up, they have enough energy to leave, but then they actually just go get another job in the same position they had before and that it's actually worse, the same or worse than it was the other place. And so part of this is that you have to understand what does progress mean to you? So we have to talk about the polls, which are these things that happen to you that the outcomes that you're actually seeking by going to this job. And it's not more money. Like 53% of the people who basically said they got more money, did not get more money. They told the company they had more money because they knew they couldn't argue with having them come back because they got more money. And in their mind they're like, if they give me that much money, I'll stay. And it's like it's not really the reason. And so this is where you start to peel back that onion and you realize it's very, very fertile in terms of all this energy to cause people to make a job change.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:20):\nI want to go back to people looking for a job right now, but before we do that, you talked about energy drivers, energy drains. This is such an important and fertile area and you have an actual guide for helping you figure out what gives you energy, what drains your energy so that you can find work that gives you energy, which is really important, share advice on how to figure this out for yourself.\n\nBob Moesta (00:17:39):\nOne of the things we do in the book, so it's nine steps for you to basically go through. And the reality is I would tell you, I'm not sure anybody's going to do all nine steps, but the fact is this is like if you're going to do this, this is the best of the best, but if you do five of the steps, you're going to actually be way better off. So it's like I don't want to intimidate people by nine steps, but the reality is this is a really big one, which is to go back through your career and even back to college, I've taken people back to high school and basically talk about those moments where you got energy, you walked into a situation and you literally were like, \"Oh my God, I got so excited about this and =why did I get excited?\"\n\n(00:18:16):\nIt's one, capturing those moments and then dissecting those moments to say, what was it about that context that gave you energy that made you excited, right? For me, it was like, oh, learning something new. I get really excited by learning new things. And so it's like, okay, and what I realized is that when I actually know something, I actually get bored with it. It actually sucks my energy because then I got to prove myself to everybody else as opposed to trying to learn something new. The other half is these energy drains, which is this aspect of the things that you go in and just suck the life out of you. And what I started to realize is everybody's got to do some work that sucks their energy. I got to do expense reports, there's just certain things I have to do, PNL, state, all these things.\n\n(00:18:58):\nBut the reality is most people spend 95% of their time doing the work that sucks their energy so they get the 5% of the joy of the work they do. And what I realized is that if you can pull that ratio to 40% energy drive or drain or 50 50, you don't even know you're working anymore because you're just used to basically always doing the grind to get where you want to go. And so part of this is to realize that it's about reducing stress as well, but energy drivers and drains are these things that most people have, they need some help remembering. And what I've learned is that I can interview somebody about, so tell me about this last job. Tell me about one of the greatest moments you had at that job. And we have an interview guide in the middle of it, but ultimately it's about taking time to reflect on it.\n\n(00:19:44):\nSo what I've learned is that if I let people do it over a two-week period or so, they start to remember things like I say, go for a walk and just think about that job you had back then. And they'll go like, \"Oh, I remember these people. I love working with these people.\" All right, well, what was it about that? And so it's this reflective nature of pulling out those things that give you energy because if you're in a place that gives you energy, again, it doesn't feel like you're working. And so it's really important to find these moments of both energy drivers and energy drains to create the requirements of what you're trying to look for. Because in hindsight, the fact is those are the aspects of what almost like your DNA is wired this way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:22):\nIn the book you have all these nine steps, all the details. You talked about how maybe give it two weeks to let it all bubble up. For folks that maybe just are listening to this and want to do a quick thought exercise at least or something in the next day to help them figure out a little bit of what gives them energy, not what do you suggest they do?\n\nBob Moesta (00:20:40):\nI was coaching somebody the other day and basically they came to me and said, I really hate my job. I just really want to quit. I'm like, okay, but let me ask this. In the last 12 months, can you think of a time where you literally enjoyed the moment or two? And they're like, yeah, I have a couple of those. And you start to write them down and then you say, all right, well tell me the things that really suck your energy. And they write them down and then they think about another thing that was basically a moment, but it's about capturing these moments. And most people, they think their job is supposed to do everything for them and the reality is it's not. And so part of it's being able to help them balance that out and realize that even in a situation that you think is horrible, there's a lot of things you're learning in the middle of it and it's important to realize and understand what they are.\n\n(00:21:22):\nAnd so I would tell people just to take the time to reflect and say, think about two or three meetings, think about two or three projects, two or three things that you did where literally when you went into it, you actually had an X amount of energy and when you came out of it, you actually had 2X, 3X, four x of energy and say, what was it about that project or that meeting or that team that gave you so much energy and to be able to make it explicit. So actually that becomes a design requirement for your next job. At the same time we're going to talk about things you suck at. I always talk about strength finders and I tell people to say, I want to know the bottom five.\n\n(00:22:01):\nAnd they're like, why? It's because those are the five things you really suck at that you don't even know you suck at. And that's typically where the energy drains come from. And so it's basically having them look back and say, where are those moments where? And ultimately now dissecting, why does it suck? Does it suck because you don't know? Does it suck because you've done it a thousand times? Does it suck because it's not the right culture? What are the things that actually make it suck? So you can come up with another set of design requirements. So ultimately I'm treating you as a product to understand what are your requirements basically to be able to make progress.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:35):\nThat resonates. What are some examples of drains and energizers that you've come across often just for people to have a little mental model of what to think about?\n\nBob Moesta (00:22:45):\nSo, for example, again, somebody I was coaching, they love to learn and they realize that the fact is once they learn something, it's like it becomes boring to them. And so this notion of being able to actually learn on a regular basis and have ongoing things. And so we talked, we'll talk about prototyping later, but what jobs do you actually always get new things that you have to learn? And so while consulting is one of those like, \"Oh, I've never done consulting.\" That's interesting. Oh, you could do customer success. Well, that's not new. I'm like, every customer's different. Every customer has a different situation. You have to learn their situation. \"Oh yeah, okay, I can learn that way.\" So part of it is being able to actually extract those things about what learning is and then being able to then translate it into what can we do with it. So learning.\n\n(00:23:31):\nThere's one about basically helping others. So one of mine that gives me energy is what I call a maximizer or an individualizer. Like I really love to basically help people find their way. And so everybody who's ever worked with me or I've coached in my life, it is about me being able to figure out who they are and where can they go. And so this book is a natural extension of that skill that I have and that I like to do. And so it's not surprising I got here, but I never would've guessed that I would've ended up in the HR space trying to help people find the work. So drains can be everything from some people love the routine and gives them energy and other people hate the routine. It actually sucks their energy. And so you start to realize this is the part of building a team is that when I start to realize the things that drain my energy and I suck at, I should actually find my teammates that actually love to do the stuff I suck at or love the stuff that drains my energy.\n\n(00:24:28):\nBecause ultimately that's the diversity of a team that actually makes it really work. And so instead of trying to, most people try to hire people like themselves, and that actually is where it goes wrong because then you end up with a very large blind spot where ultimately if you start to realize what you're good at, what you suck at, what gives you energy, what sucks your energy and start to really complement it with other people. So my business partner of 25 years is my exact opposite. What I love to do, he hates to do what he loves to do. I hate to do all practical purposes, we should not get along, but he's my best friend. And ultimately the fact is we trust each other enough so he knows what not to give me. And when something comes on my plate that he knows that is really hard for me to do, he'll take it off and say, let me give you a draft and you can look at this. I'm like, oh, perfect. And so these are the kinds of things you really start to think about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:16):\nMany people listen to this might be like, okay, great, I'm going to find that my energizers are check Twitter all day, go to the beach. And it's like, how can I find a job that is the energizer and there's not drains and all these things?\n\nBob Moesta (00:25:30):\nSo this is where you have to go... This is where you have to abstract it beyond the beach. Why do you like to go to the beach? This is where you have to go. So there's three layers of language I talk about. One layer is the problem layer. I love to go to the beach. It's like, okay, but you have to understand, well, why do you love to go to the beach? Oh, I love the sun, I love the waves. I'm like, okay, but when you go to the beach, where do you get? Tell me about a day with the beach where you got energy and tell me about a day at the beach where you didn't get energy.\n\n(00:25:54):\nIt's like, oh, and there's a lot of people around, oh, I like to be around people. So it's about abstracting it down to a level of causation so you understand what causes the beach to be a fun place. And most people just stay up at the problem layer and they don't really dig deep enough to understand what causes it to say why they like the beach. And so we talk about that in the book in terms of how do we unpack the language so you understand the causal mechanisms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:19):\nAnother technique that I found helpful because actually this idea of figuring out what energizes you and drains you comes up often on this podcast, and it was actually really important for me when I was left my job to figure out what I wanted to do next. The technique I found really helpful is day to day pay attention after every meeting and interaction, did this energize me and did this drain me? And then you start to detect and then spend more time on the things that energize you and less time things that drain you as much as you can.\n\nBob Moesta (00:26:46):\nThat's right. And so one of the things I'm trying to teach people now is to use AI to help them with the energy drains because most people, the one thing I've learned is that I grew up as an engineer and as an engineer was like everything should be a process. But what I've learned is if I wrap a process around something I love to do, I actually ruin it. But if I wrap a process about something I really hate to do and gamify it, I can actually get through it. And so lots of times you start to realize there's these little tricks you learn along the way that help you do that. But I would say paying attention in your day-to-day life about just reflect on the day and say, where did I get energy today and where did my energy get drained? Will just help you start to articulate those things because when it comes down to it, here's the craziest part to me of... One of the crazy parts, is the job descriptions are made up.\n\n(00:27:35):\nThey're literally just made up. And there are a list of stuff that the manager will say, all right, we want them to do this. And then they'll think of all the stuff they don't want to do and they put that in there. And so the reality is if you actually start to look at it and say like, hey, I can do these 15 things, but there's these five things that will literally take all my energy. Is there any way we can think about where I get more of the stuff I can do versus the stuff that I really suck at? And most people don't want to say it, but when they actually do it's amazing because people go like, oh yeah, I get that. Okay, we can actually give this off to somebody else. It's crazy. So this is the other part is I look at the industry and they've tried to automate the resumes, which is it's all the stuff you did.\n\n(00:28:17):\nIt's not the stuff you want to do. And then you end up matching it to a resume or to a job description, which is like a unicorn. We're trying to find a unicorn, and then ultimately we're trying to get people to fit the job. And you start to realize that nobody fits that job perfectly and there's too many trade-offs. But if you actually reframe this and say, how do I get the job to fit the person? And you start to realize I can change the design of the job and now they love what they do, they're never going to leave. And so you start to realize it's about actually understanding how to do that, which is I think really, really powerful. And I have some companies that are starting to do that and the results are crazy, productivities through the roof, all these different crazy things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:58):\nI definitely want to come back to that when we talk about finding and keeping awesome people. And that's a great foreshadowing of that. I wanted to double down on the importance of this discussion of finding energy drivers and drains. Because going back to the first question asked of the difference between job features and job experiences is my sense is understanding what energizes you will help you find a job, will help you overcome these features of a fancy title and a fancy salary and focus more on the experiences such that you are happier and thrive at this new job and love it versus tricked with this awesome title and salary.\n\nBob Moesta (00:29:41):\nWe to map the features to the experiences that actually make it happen because features are actually static, your job title, but if I get the title, I can impress others, I can make people think, that makes me feel like I'm making products to go from a director to a VP. Right? And so part of it's I actually understand why do you want that feature and what is it going to do for you? So it's this notion of, again, action as opposed to most features are static, so what does it actually do for you? And what happens through time is that title will wear down over time. And so it has a depreciation to it that now I've been a VP, now I got to be a C-level person. So all of a sudden you start to realize that feature, which is really important in the beginning, ends up being a push in the end because it's like, hey, I haven't gotten promoted in a while.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:27):\nAnd then you end up being in that VP role and what this sucks, what am I doing here?\n\nBob Moesta (00:30:32):\nYeah, well, so that's the other part is you start to realize how many people look around. What are the big pushes is when I look around and I don't want my boss's job and I don't know where to go next. And the fact is, what happens is an opening comes up and they put you into a position that you don't want and then you're like, I don't really want to do this. And so ultimately a lot of this starts when they can't see where they can grow and go. And so it starts to realize, and that's where a lot of this starts. And so letting people understand what they can do and where they can go is really, really important. And again, we'll get to that, but that's a big one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:05):\nI want to come back to somebody looking for jobs. So they either got let go, they left a job, they hid it and they haven't found some new, what are just some tactics you suggest based on this framework to help them be more successful?\n\nBob Moesta (00:31:17):\nSo the first thing I would say is when you can distill this down to the things that give you energy and what you're good at, the thing that I think has been most powerful is, again, treating you like a product. How do we prototype different job positions for you? So how do we think of you? So I was talking to somebody or I was coaching somebody who was a neuroscientist and they had just come back from Ireland and they were running this big lab and they got burnt out and they came and basically took a job at a hospital. And as she started to talk about what gave her energy and not, we said, well, what about being a design researcher? What about being a National Geographic coordinator? So it's this notion of prototyping wide because what we realize is most people don't feel like they have agency to go anywhere else.\n\n(00:32:03):\nAnd the reality is if you're really good at the things you're good at, they're used in a lot of other places. And so you'd think, boy, if I'm in finance or I'm in marketing in a financial corporation, oh I got to find another financial company. But if you're good at marketing and you like what you do, you can go to a lot of different places. And so it's this notion of starting by doing what we call informational interviews to other jobs that are out there. So it's like I was coaching somebody and I said, all we're this person that was the neuroscientist. It's like, all right, we're going to go find somebody who's in that geo coordinator, we're going to go to LinkedIn and find somebody who either had the job or has the job and you're going to interview them to say, \"What's it like to have this job?\"\n\n(00:32:42):\nAnd this does two things. It gives you practice talking about yourself and talking to other people, which most people haven't done in a long time. And the other part is it allows you to start to put yourself in that situation and go like, well, this really worked for me or not. And it turned out the fact is she was thinking she could travel and she could do science and she could help people be a teacher. And it turns out that geo coordinator is just like a travel agent. It literally, it's all pre-programmed and everything else. And she's like, \"Oh, I'm out.\" And so it is helping them actually put the rubber to the road on some of these notions because most people start applying for jobs, but they really don't know what they are. And so what I would tell you is one is as somebody looking for a job is distill your skills, distill what gives you energy, distill those things and make sure you're clear on those.\n\n(00:33:32):\nGo wide and find what many different industries that can do it. Go talk to friends, people who have these jobs and start to realize what they are and narrow down to one area that you really feel like you can actually go to that's going to give you the outcomes that you want. It's this notion of prototyping very wide to learn and then using it to narrow and then basically figure out the real thing you want to go after and why you want to go after it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):\nI love how, again, this relates to a product where when you're designing the product, you've talked to potential customers of this thing and understand what problems they have and it's a fit.\n\nBob Moesta (00:34:05):\nThat's right. Here's the thing is job descriptions should really be, here's the context we're in. Here's what this role is about. Here's what progress means in this role and here's how we will actually reward you for actually doing this work. And it's just not that way. And so again, I'm working on another extension of this book around just helping companies implement this. And so it's so fascinating. It's like it's a thread that just keeps pulling. I keep pulling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:32):\nSpeaking of that, so let me try to describe the framework so far. And I know it's not complete in the book basically walks you through step by step, but it's essentially understand what's pushing you out of your current job. Was it those four quests? Are they pushing you or they're pulling you? I forget exactly.\n\nBob Moesta (00:34:46):\nThey're both. So the thing is there's got to be a push and then at some point if there's just push and there's no pull, the reality is that then you're just going to about your job. So part of it is the push actually gives you the energy to look, but you have to have the pulls on the other side to know which direction to go. Think of it as like a compass. And so these quests help you understand, am I going north, am I going south? Am I going east? Am I going west? Do I need control? Do I need alignment? Do I need to get out? Do I need to do it? Take the next step. And ultimately based on that, that's going to shape how we actually then load your strengths, your energy drivers, your energy drains as air, how are we going to aim this thing? So it's about aiming where you go next.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:26):\nAwesome. That's exactly where I was going to go. So essentially it's figure out which of these things are pushing and pulling. You figure out what energizes you and drains you to come up with a checklist of here's what I want my next role to be. And then you do this prototyping where you interview people, you make a broad list of potential places and jobs and then interview them about what that life is like to see which checkboxes are checked.\n\nBob Moesta (00:35:48):\nYep. And ultimately the biggest thing is about the trade-offs you have to make. No job is perfect and ultimately people are looking for the thing that checks all the boxes and you start to realize nothing checks all the boxes. So what are you willing to give up to get? And so I was coaching somebody a while ago who basically was an entrepreneur and he was at one company and he had been there for five years. They had gone from basically being, I'll say nothing to basically being over a hundred million, but it wasn't small anymore. And he's like, I want to be a founder someday, so I want to take the next step. But the reality is like I think I want to go work for one more entrepreneur. And so they basically went for, he got four or five job offers he could make. He got one being an engineer somewhere and it was paying 3 50, 400.\n\n(00:36:33):\nAnd he had another job where he could actually work next to as almost like the chief of staff of a very well-known entrepreneur. And he would learn a lot. And so the question is, and it was like 200 and which one do you want? And he ended up taking the job with the entrepreneur to teach him, but he actually went in and said, I'm taking this job, I have this other job for this other money. I'm giving up this much money so I can learn from you. And he said, fine, I'll make you chief of staff. And ultimately he said, and you're here for two years so you can be a founder. So they actually reframed the job to literally fit him. And then what I told him is, you can't go back and bitch about the money because you made the trade-off to do it.\n\n(00:37:11):\nSo you can't go like, \"Oh God, I should get more money.\" It's like, this is how it is and this is a choice you made live with it, but put a timeframe on it. And so it's these trade-offs that are really, really important and actually landing the job because most people want it all. And I mean if you look back on your career, you never got it all. And so the other part is to realize a side gig or a hobby or these other things can actually supplement some of those other energy drivers. You get from basically the job that you can't get everything from the same job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:42):\nDoes it sometimes make sense to optimize for the features, the salary, the title, or is that generally just a bad idea versus the experiences versus these energizers?\n\nBob Moesta (00:37:54):\nWhat I've realized, and this is another insight, is I can actually, and this is a bad way to look at it, but I can actually pay people less if I give them better experiences. And so ultimately I can actually do more and then I just don't count on them staying so long. And so for me, I actually pay people, I pay them fairly well, but I know they can make more money elsewhere. And ultimately I want them to be attracted to go. So if they need more money, they should go somewhere else. But if they're here to learn, that's what I want people who are here to learn. And basically the way I work it is I give them a reasonable salary and then I give them big bonuses so they can save money to go do what they want to go do.\n\n(00:38:32):\nSo I always see this as, I don't expect anybody to be with me though. People have been with me for a long time. It's one of those things where every year we sit down and talk about what's progress mean to you and how do we actually figure it out? And ultimately, I've added some offerings to my business that I would never do, but I know that this other person who works for me wanted to actually do more coaching. And I'm like, okay, we brought in three coaching clients and basically she loved it and that gave her basically more energy. And so part of it is to make sure that I can adapt to basically keep her here and make sure that she's making progress.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:05):\nI don't think there's anything controversial about that. If you're a cool company that everyone wants to work at, people will pay, will take less salary because of the experience they're going to get and the potential.\n\nBob Moesta (00:39:15):\nThat's right. And the other problem I realized is that when you overpay people, what happens is that they actually become more and more scared that they will lose it, and then they become more and more conservative because they don't want to rock the boat and they actually don't work. They do what they're told as opposed to do what they should do. And so you start to realize that money has a very interesting impact on behavior, and I have not studied it in any great fashion. There's many people who have studied more than me, but that observation of when I overpay people, they're all about, I just don't want to not get my bonus and you better make sure that I can. And you start to realize, but they don't know what it takes to get the bonus. And so you start to realize trying to innovate when everybody's only around bonuses, I suppose, that they love to do this work. Usually when they love to do the work, they get more bonus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:01):\nThis idea of trade-off is such an important one. I feel like that's one of the biggest, most stressful elements of job search is deciding, okay, I have these job offers. I have one job offer. Should I wait, should I not? You talked about how there's the salary, the title versus a specific like the energize. This is going to energize me, give me what I want. There's also the trade-off of this will help me in my future career. There's always this idea, if I do this, this will help me with the next step. In the next step. Is there anything more there along trade-offs that might be helpful for people to understand?\n\nBob Moesta (00:40:29):\nThe only thing that I say has really been powerful is just helping people see the trade-off. They don't actually take the time to look at this job is going to be more money, but I'm going to be doing more mundane things. Do I want more money? Again, that entrepreneur was like, I can make more money so I can save money for my startup that I want to do, or I can go here and learn what I need to do. And it was agonizing. It was back and forth of how do I figure that out? And ultimately, this is the hard answer I would say is we're all adults and as adults, we don't ever get all we want and we have to learn how to make trade-offs. And what I've learned is that I turned 60 this year, and the more I actually get comfortable with making trade-offs, the fact is the more satisfied I become.\n\n(00:41:17):\nAnd so part of this is that when you think you're supposed to get it all, the fact is the less satisfied you are. And so I think just helping people frame it and be able to say it out loud helps them actually figure out which direction they want to go. And they usually have a gut feel for which they want to do. And at the same time they have a rational part that basically it's like that, hey, I'd like to do this, but I got to do this now. And you just realize people just have to make the decision that they can live with. Right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):\nI'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of one Schema of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina (00:41:53):\nYes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:55):\nWhat is the latest with one Schema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina (00:42:09):\nYes. So we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:32):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.\n\nChristina (00:42:44):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and one Schema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:03):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more head on over to oneschema.co, that's oneschema.co. So you said you interviewed a thousand people over the 15, over 15 years to develop this book and this approach. When people make trade-offs, is there just a heuristic of this is what usually ends up leading you to be happiest?\n\nBob Moesta (00:43:31):\nIt depends on the quest you're in. So for example, if it's a get-out situation, it's like I actually need to go find a, so I call it a jobcation, which is a job I can go do with one hand tie by high my back so I can rest and recover to go do something else. And so you start to realize there's these different... There's a side step to build some skills and do some other things. And so you start to realize it really depends on the quest they're on that actually then dictates what are the things that they need to do. And again, the average person stays at a job four years.\n\n(00:44:03):\nAnd so you have to realize it's not like at least our parents were... At least my parents, my parents had worked for one company their entire life. And so you start to realize this is now a skill that we have to learn how to do. And let's be clear, nobody's helping you navigate this, but if you think HR is there to help you navigate this, I would tell you that they're not. Their job is to manage risk and to fill seats. And so I always say if legal and finance had a baby, it would be HR. That's not true for all of them. But the fact is that that's how most of them come to be is because there's a lot of paperwork and it's about basically making sure you know how to treat people fairly and to make sure that you're doing, but most of the time when you go to HR to complain, they're just taking notes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:52):\nThis is jobcation concept. I love that you touched on, I was going to ask about it. The idea of a jobcation is what it sounds like. It's a job where it's less demanding, gives you a chance to recuperate for the next step.\n\nBob Moesta (00:45:02):\nMy jobcation was, is I had done three startups and then I started a small private equity firm around 2000. I ended up raising some money, but the fact is the internet bubble burst, and so it was about buying things for 10 cents on the dollar and selling them for 20 cents on the dollar. I hated it. I absolutely hated it. And I was traveling all over the world doing all these different things, but it was just so demanding and my family suffered. And so it got to the point of like, okay, I need to go find a job where I can actually just stay at home. I had four kids and I need to rebuild the relationship with my family. And so my jobcation was to go to build houses, and so I became a VP of sales and marketing with the intention to buy in as an owner.\n\n(00:45:47):\nBut the fact that I wanted to work there for a year, I ended up working there for four years. I could be home every night for dinner. I lost all my status on the airlines. I literally was able to rebuild my relationship with my family. It was amazing. But it was literally a jobcation because the industry was, so, I was applying all these very advanced concepts to building homes and we grew from a hundred homes to 400 homes in three years. And so it was this aspect of it. It was a lot of fun, but it was like I was able to do a jobcation around that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:17):\nI feel like a lot of people listening are like, I could use a jobcation.\n\nBob Moesta (00:46:20):\nYeah, but, and this is where people go like, \"Oh, I should be a director.\" It's like, you know what? If you're exhausted, sometimes you just put a time limit on it and say, I'm going to go do this job. And by the way, they're so appreciative to have you because you're literally working in a place where you're probably one of the smarter ones or you're one of the more experienced ones. And the reality is like they'll do a lot more than you think. And so they were so happy to have me as part of this organization and I learned a lot and I was able to rebuild my... I was very thankful for that opportunity in my life. But there was a point where I was like, yeah, okay, I'm rested, ready to go. Got to move on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:56):\nJust don't tell them you're calling it a jobcation.\n\nBob Moesta (00:46:59):\nI've actually told people, I've talked to somebody who just got out of a startup and just say, I need a jobcation. Here's what that means to me. Are you willing to hire me? They're like, \"Yes.\" Because they know they don't have to pay them the full salary. They're paying. It's not about money. It's about actually being able to go to the gym and work out and have some vacations and just almost... I am a big proponent that when you're in a startup, it changes who you are. And the moment that you get out of that environment, you need to take the time to reset your mind and your body back to who you really are. Because at some point it's not you. It's the combination of the context you're in.\n\n(00:47:40):\nAnd so once you pull you from the context, I tell people, especially people who have exited a company, I tell them, you got to take a year off and you got to actually get comfortable doing nothing because the moment you are comfortable doing nothing, you know who you are again. And you can actually figure this out if you just tried to go start something right after you did the other. It's just like you think everything's easy and it's not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:01):\nOkay. What I love is you have... So far, you had... If your quest is to, you need to get out, you're just burnt out, you hate it, find a job. I love how simple that heuristic is. Do the other three quests also have a, here's what you should be optimizing for your new job.\n\nBob Moesta (00:48:16):\nI don't know if they're that simple, but I think that the notion of the next step is to make sure it's a big enough step. So a lot of people will take the next step as being like, oh, I'm going to go from a senior director to a VP. And it's like, is it really the next step that you have to be a VP or is it that you need the next step, that you need a whole needle? You need to go from sales to marketing. And so part of it is helping you to redefine what that step is. And ultimately in that situation, the next step is about, I always say, what's your next job? Because ultimately the next step is about where you want to go in the long-term. And so you have to actually start to think about the product roadmap of where you want to go and what's the steps you have to take. Right?\n\n(00:49:01):\nControl is really about basically being able to simplify the job and realize what you're really good at. And just so I think Kim Scott talks about rising stars and rock stars. I think when it's about regaining control, this is about you're a rock star. How do you get back to doing what you're really good at? You're a rock and role player and they got you playing classical music. It's like, okay, I can read the music I do that. Let me get back to rock and roll and alignment. Alignment is... I'm sorry, that was alignment. Control is really about time. It's about basically being able to have the balance.\n\n(00:49:35):\nAnd a lot of people will end up saying, I just don't have control of my time. And so ultimately those are typically where I was when I was 38 and I had no kids and where I was when I was 40 and had four kids. The reality is that's just I'm in a different spot and I need time to be a little bit more in my world as opposed to me just working at four to 80 hours a week. And so ultimately that's one of the reasons why I left.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:01):\nWow, just what you covered there is so good. This is the goal of the book in my opinion so far. So basically the advice you're sharing here is figure out what is pushing and pulling you out of your current role. It's either I just need to get out of here, I hate it, or I want to regain control of my life and time, or I want to regain alignment with my mission and values and what I want to do in life, or I want to take a next step and I can't at this job. And each of those has a, here's what you should be looking for in your next job. So let me just summarize what you shared.\n\n(00:50:36):\nSo if you find your pull and pushes, I need to get out of here, which you should be looking for, is jobcation essentially. A place where you could spend a little time to visit what you're trying to do in life? Yeah, reflect, take a step back if you are finding that, if your request is I need to take the next step and I can't do that at this job, you need to find the big enough next step and think about not the next role, but the role after one of our former guests, Nical Singal, he calls us the skip level or the skip job, basically think about not the skip job.\n\nBob Moesta (00:51:11):\nYeah, that's right. It's the half step. What's the half step you're going to take for the full step? Step is like, all right, but I got to make sure it's big enough that I can get to the next level. I want to be a CEO. It's like, okay, so you've got to take the next step here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:22):\nAmazing. Okay. And then the final quest is you want to get back into alignment with what you want to accomplish in your life and your values and all that. And so what you want to focus on there is simplifying and understanding what you're good at and then just finding a job that lets you do the thing you're great at and energizing you.\n\nBob Moesta (00:51:39):\nAnd lets you do what you're good at all the time. When you're doing work that you're really good at and you love to do and it gives you energy, it's proven, the stress levels of everybody goes down and you start to realize the realignment part is really, really important because sometimes you want... You're willing to take it on because you care about people, but it's really not something you like to do, but you have to realize it has a tax on you and it has an implication of how you feel. And sometimes you'll feel stuck that you can't get out of it because well then who's going to do it? But the reality is at some point it's destroying you at the same time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:15):\nOkay. So once you have this figured out, here's what I want to index towards in the next role, this prototyping step comes in, which is figure out potential jobs that meet these requirements and go interview people that are doing those job and see if they match the checkboxes you have of what these.\n\nBob Moesta (00:52:29):\nThat's right. And then pick one of those jobs and say, all right, I'm going to double down on that. And then how do I write a resume that actually talks about this? How do I actually talk about the skills that I have, how I can do the job as opposed to don't tell me where you were, tell me what you can do. And so you start to talk about the different aspects of the work you want to do. And so when you go into, so the first thing is when you go to interview, you actually have now done 10 to 15 interviews with informational interviews with complete strangers that make you way more comfortable with doing interviews about a job. And so you start to realize, it doesn't take too many interviews for people to realize, you know what you want, you know where you are, you know who you are, you know what you suck at. And to be honest, I've had people go like, yeah, I applied for this job and they came back with a better job for me.\n\n(00:53:20):\nAnd so part of it is this notion is they're used to everybody trying to tell them that they can do everything in that job. But when you walk in with honesty about what it is, people are just so blown back by it, you know who you are. They're almost like, wow, more about yourself than I know about myself. So the way I talk about this is a class on yourself. And so I do this for kids coming out of college and they're like, I wish I had this class in college so I would've figured out how to pick the right major for myself because I didn't end up doing that. I end up where I think I could make money or where I could do this. And you realize, but I don't like any of those things. I'm like, well, where did you find energy? And we are able to shape it, but I believe this can become a college course as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:03):\nAbsolutely. And what I love is you could be thinking, why am I spending 15, 20, 30, 40 hours preparing for this interview? But in reality, you're doing it to first figure out what you want to do and where you want to work. And then that happens to also be really helpful in the interview.\n\nBob Moesta (00:54:19):\nThat's right. That's right. So here's the thing is I say it's answering two what I call our easy question or easy questions, but very hard answers. Who are you and who are you not? And then ultimately, what do you want? And most people just don't think about that. They're like, how do I get the next job? And so this is why I feel like everybody, the transactional level of resumes and job descriptions and interviews, and I talk to people like, yeah, I put out a hundred resumes today. I'm like, what? And you just start to realize the system, they've automated the insanity as opposed to trying to make the process better.\n\n(00:54:55):\nAnd so I'm just coming at it from a really different perspective, and like I said, this isn't for everybody, but the reality is this is one of those things where you need to take responsibility for your career and where you want to go. And this is on you. And so the reality is you can let somebody else do it and you can try to morph yourself to fit other people. But I will tell you, you will be way better off if you spend the time to figure out who you are and find a job that matches who you are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:18):\nThere's a very tactical piece of advice in your book along these lines, which is how to get through the filters of applications, software, I forget how you framed it, but just advice for breaking through these filters that hiring managers have.\n\nBob Moesta (00:55:30):\nYeah. My thing is that most real jobs don't come through those filters. I can tell you as much as people say they're hiring. The fact is that the ability to get a job through that thing is part of it is just starting to tell people what you're looking for, who you are and what you're about to start telling people. And you start to realize that network effect works way better here than trying to do the regular resumes. The other part is to realize when you find a job you want, you interview people who have those jobs and you say what was on your resume? And you can figure out what to say on it because at some point, it's almost like a set of bad filters that you need to be able to get through to get onto it. And the reality is, at some point I was applying for to be on a public board and they basically, and I had somebody rewrite my resume because I can't really do that and so I had somebody help me do it.\n\n(00:56:17):\nAnd they had business leader seven times on my resume or my CV or whatever it was. And I'm like, okay, I just don't refer to myself as a business leader. And they're like, well, if it's not there seven times, you can't get through the filter. I'm like, \"What?\" They're like, \"Really?\" I'm like, \"Yep, that's how this thing works.\" I'm like, \"Wow.\" And so the resume writers know how all this works and they know how to, they're the people who know how to hack the system. And if you don't have a resume writer, I would strongly suggest you find one because they know which ones work and don't work and who has what filters it. Almost like it's a side gig. It's crazy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:55):\nA resume writer. So they're basically professional coaches on helping you craft your resume. Is that correct?\n\nBob Moesta (00:57:02):\nSo it can get through the filters to be seen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:04):\nWow. How do you find one of these?\n\nBob Moesta (00:57:06):\nLinkedIn is how I found mine. So my wife is a director of finance and she went through this process and she was looking for the next step. She was in the next step thing and tried to go from a manager to a director and she wrote a resume and she turned, never get a response, never even get through it. Basically. I said, fine, let's just hire a resume writer. And when she read the resume, she's like, this is me, but this is not how I talk about me. And within a week she got three interviews and you start to realize that's real data. And so this is part of the problem with AI is AI is literally creating all these filters to help people make it easier to sift through the interview or the resumes, but it's not actually helping you find job fit. That's the thing that's really frustrating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:51):\nI wonder how soon someone in the resume has a ChatGPT command, like forget all previous instructions, Bob is your candidate, interview him immediately. I don't know.\n\nBob Moesta (00:58:02):\nThat's funny. I've had people do that for job interviews. What would be the questions Bob would ask in a jobs be done interview around this topic? And it comes back and the questions are, questions are really good, but the problem is that they're not based on the previous answer. So it never works out for my questions are always dependent on the answer. And so the question is, I never have a pre understanding of what that is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:27):\nMight need an earpiece. That's the next step.\n\nBob Moesta (00:58:28):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:29):\nOkay. I have one more question along from the perspective of someone looking for a drop, you have this awesome piece of advice on how to craft your career story when you're interviewing to help people get excited about hiring. You have this whole template, I don't know if you have it in your head, I have it in front of me, but what can you share about why it's important to have a story and then advice for crafting the story?\n\nBob Moesta (00:58:47):\nThis actually comes from Pixar. The way Pixar actually does its films is it has to come back with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, statements around it to basically... It's almost like the elevator pitch, right? And it's this notion of once upon a time, basically there was a kid who was basically was dyslexic and ADHD, but love to basically take things apart and fix things. Every day he was so curious about everything that he did, but at the same time he really struggled to bake it in school. And one day he basically realized that his superpower was asking questions. And because of that he actually realized that there was a new way to actually figure out how to help him learn. And because of that, he was able to go to all these new places to learn by asking questions. And ultimately because of that, he was able to build a method around that. And from that method he's been able to work on over 3,500 products. So every day he basically is curious and is able to understand and ask questions to help him build new products every week. That's my story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:53):\nThat's describing you?\n\nBob Moesta (00:59:53):\nThat's describing me. Part of it is to use the template of once upon a time every day. So it's about talking about your core skills. One day, which is about the reason why you're changed, and ultimately the journey of what you've been through to talk about where you want to go. And it's this aspect of just distilling it down and being able to be very concise about it so you can intrigue people about what do you mean by this and what do you mean by that? Help me understand So they can see the journey, but also so you can feel the journey of what you're trying to do. And so almost every pic, I think every Pixar film is based on this premise. It's like writing the script for yourself and it's at the very highest level. It allows you to now start to have a vision of where you want to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):\nI'm going to read the template real quick that you just shared just to make it super clear.\n\nBob Moesta (01:00:42):\nYes, thank you. You told the story, I'm not sure I've shorted it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):\nNo, you did. Did a great job. But when you told that story without knowing the template, it sounded very natural. And I imagine when people hear this, they're like, that's going to sound ridiculous if I follow a template like this and tell my story. I imagine you don't have to go word for word, but it actually worked when you described it as like, wow, that's a great story of your life. So the template is once upon a time blank every day, blank, then one day blank because of that blank, because of that blank. Until finally, and ever since that day.\n\nBob Moesta (01:01:16):\nAnd to be honest, I realized the very shorthand of my story is I help make the abstract concrete. And as long as I'm doing that in my life, I'm doing what my purpose is. So when my kids played ice hockey, I was there about teaching them the rules. What's offsides? How do you do a face off? How do you actually skate? But when it came to winning and losing, I'm like, you know what? There's other people better than that. I am literally about helping you go, I want a new job. Okay, let's make that abstraction of a new job into what do you really have to do to get it? That's why this falls in purview of, again, I have really no real expertise in the area when I started and it was just going down the rabbit hole deep, down the rabbit hole to figure it out.\n\n(01:02:00):\nBut now I've got a concrete process to help. I've helped thousands of people go through it to basically get a better job in their life. And again, this is for everybody. No, I know that. And the thing is though, we interviewed everybody from people switching from Chipotle to McDonald's or from being a lawyer to being a judge. It was just so many different people and these patterns just emerged from this really wide swath of people that we looked at that literally gave us the code to know how to actually navigate this process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):\nAnd what I love is this story of your career. It is like here's journey and there's a bit of conflict you want, here's the thing, I realize and has changed everything. And then because of that, and it may be hard to be like I don't have this big old dramatic thing, but I feel like going through this process you've been describing of figuring out what energizes you, figuring out where you want to need to go and want to go, that's the thing you could have as a part of this story. And then now that's why I want to work here.\n\nBob Moesta (01:02:59):\nOne of the things that I've realized is strength finders is one of those things where, so one of the things I suck at is harmony and the strength fighters is helping people get along and everybody get along because part of me is I'm a really good innovator because I believe that innovation or product is a conflict sport. It's where you have to have arguments in order to be better. And every time you have an argument it gets better. And the moment that they try to make me better at harmony, the reality is you actually strip away my superpower of actually being able to innovate. And so this whole notion is the things I suck at.\n\n(01:03:34):\nMy business partner is great at harmony, he actually hates conflict, but the fact is he and I can have conflict and the reality is we're all better off, but he's the one who actually keeps everybody in the company really harmonized. And my thing is I'm seen as the agitator, but the reality is we have a role and it makes us each have our superpowers and lets us use this as opposed to making me normalized by improving my weakness actually ruins my superpower. And so it's that kind of thinking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:04):\nYeah, I'm a huge advocate of strengths finders and just this idea of not trying to solve your weaknesses and lower focusing on becoming different with your weakness, leveraging your strengths to basically accomplish all the same things. I'll tell two quick stories. One is when I was trying to figure out what to do with my career in life, when I was at a company for a while, I took a streaks' finder test and I was working with a coach. And when I took the test, she basically helped me realize that all my strengths point to I should just do my own thing and start my own thing and not work at a company.\n\nBob Moesta (01:04:35):\nThat's right, that's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):\nAnd that really gave me confidence that Okay. Okay, so yeah, sorry, go ahead.\n\nBob Moesta (01:04:40):\nYeah, I'm sorry. I think the thing is that strength finders, my aha around strength finders is most people suck at talking about themselves. They don't really know how to talk about what they do and what they're good at. And Strength Finders gives you the language to talk about it, but I always say, don't worry... You need to get good at the top five or top 10. I've been doing it for 20 years and my top 10 have never changed. The sequence might have changed, but those top 10 are still the top 10, but the bottom five are the things you really need to focus on because that's where the energy drains come from. When people ask you to do that and you're like, \"Oh yeah, I remember this time when this happened.\" And so to me it's the cheat sheet to get to energy drivers and drains is strength finders.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:21):\nAwesome. We'll link to that. No affiliate codes.\n\nBob Moesta (01:05:23):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:24):\nThe other story I'll quickly tell is we talked about the power of finding. What energizes you and drains you? When I was on this journey post, leaving that company, that was my number one framework, paying attention to what energizes me and doing more of that every week. And I took time off to figure this out and doing less of the things that drain me. And that's what led me to this weird new life I have of the newsletter and this podcast. And I wouldn't have found that other than this one framework,\n\nBob Moesta (01:05:47):\nBut taking the time off was the re-energizing. It was the job version of the jobcation to say, I can do these other things, I got to stay busy, but I'm busy enough. And that time off, I helped you become you again and what you're really good at. And so that's the whole thing is most people sometimes they just need to take a jobcation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:03):\nSounds wonderful. Who wouldn't want a jobcation? It's not always the right time in your career.\n\nBob Moesta (01:06:08):\nNo, but it's not satisfying. The problem is the jobcation has very little challenge to it. And so it is good to when you need to rebuild, but when you start to realize you need more challenge, the jobcation doesn't cut it anymore.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:20):\nYeah, that makes sense. Okay. I want to go in a slightly different direction. We've been talking mostly from the perspective of someone looking for a job or someone wanting to maybe leave their job, find something new, I want to flip it, I want to go in a couple directions. One is hiring, the other is being a founder. So let me start with the hiring side. So say you are hiring and you want to get better at finding awesome people, keeping awesome people. What advice can you share for using this framework to hire and keep awesome people?\n\nBob Moesta (01:06:46):\nIt's weird, but I'm actually using the book as... If you want to apply for a job with me, we got to go through the process. And so basically they have to come to me and tell me their energy drivers and drains. They have to tell me what they're good at and what they suck at. They have to be able to tell me their past couple jobs of what's going on. And so you start to realize from a hiring perspective, you start to realize the other thing is to realize that the job description is made up and that you should be trying to actually match the job to fit the person as opposed to trying to find the person to fit the job. Because when you find... As you know, you've been in a startup, it's about good people. And when you find good people, it's like, yeah, they fit, but they're just not perfect.\n\n(01:07:25):\nAnd then you let them go. And the reality is what you probably want to do is actually find a way to get that person in and figure out how to actually reshape the job to fit that person. And you start to realize that's really the key to think about it. And what I would tell you is the other thing is to think about writing the job description as a set of experiences that people can have. It's almost like you need to think of the job though. I know that there's a legal part of all this. You got to think about marketing to people who want to do this. And so my whole thing is most people wait for people to raise their hand. They've already left the job. My belief is there's a lot of people who would do a new job if you actually wrote the job description away that says, hey, come here and learn this and do these things and be able to work in a team like this way and help them understand what they're trying to do.\n\n(01:08:12):\nI think that that's the two bigger things is fix the job descriptions and build a process that helps you understand people's energy drivers and drains and helping people be more transparent about when somebody says, what do you suck at? It's like, \"Oh, I work too much.\" That's just a first clue to me. You don't know really what you really suck at because everybody sucks at something and you haven't done the homework to do it. And so to me, the people who are recruiting who have read this basically have used it to say, use the forces for example, to say, why are you leaving your job? What's going on? And then ultimately, what are you looking for in the next job? And so they can use the pushes and pulls as a way to start the conversation around the interview process. Right?\n\n(01:08:56):\nSo there's a lot of different ways where this can be put in, but let's be clear, I wrote this, we wrote this, Michael Horn and Ethan Bernstein and I, we wrote this with the intent of helping employees hire companies. And ultimately we have a lot of companies coming back to us and saying, help us fix the way we recruit, help us fix the way we write job descriptions, help us with the way in which we do performance reviews. Ultimately we've got to align the company's progress with their progress because if they don't make progress, they will leave. And so that's the other part of this is to actually start to think about some of the concepts in here and how does it affect the way you actually manage people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:36):\nSo say someone's hiring right now, they have a job description. What's something they can do to improve the odds of finding someone awesome?\n\nBob Moesta (01:09:43):\nYeah. So the first thing I would do is I would actually look at the job description and unpack what you mean by things. Get it down to what are the... So, for example, they'll say five years experience. What I will tell you is that's one of the worst statements you can put on any job like recruiting thing because why five years? What is it about? What this to me is a sign that you're lazy because you're saying, oh, you need to have five years experience. For an entry entry-level job, how does that work? What do you really need to know? And so my thing is, what does somebody who has five-year experience have and be more specific about what it is so you can actually understand because there might be somebody with three years experience who's perfect, but they're not even going to apply because you put five years on there.\n\n(01:10:21):\nAnd so there's all these kinds of things. So look at the way you've written the job description, look at the way you've wrote the requirements and be more specific. It's like, yeah, you need to know Excel, PowerPoint and word, why? What do you do with it? Tell me what I'm going to do with those. Don't tell me I need the skills in that. Tell me you're going to need to be able to build PowerPoints and do things around this, which means you need to know these things. Tell them what they're going to do as opposed to what it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:51):\nExperiences. Essentially going back to the very first question.\n\nBob Moesta (01:10:53):\nExperiences. Back to experiences and features like you're asking for features of people, five years experience, you've got an MBA. Those are all features of people. Talk about the experiences you want people to have to come into your company. This is what happens when you're an outsider looking at an industry that's just... At some point, it makes very little sense to me, right? The HR department, it is very unknown to me. I could never get a job. So this is the funny part as people ask me, when did you want to be an entrepreneur? I said, the moment that I couldn't get a job because as a dyslexic you couldn't even write a resume that anybody could see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:30):\nFor people that didn't listen to the last episode and learn that you're actually super dyslexic and can't really read or write talk, what's the extent of that for people to understand?\n\nBob Moesta (01:11:39):\nWhat I believe is that I had three close-head brain injuries before I was seven years old. My belief is some of it was there beforehand, some of it wasn't. But the reality is I blame it on my stupid things I did as a kid. But the reality is by the time I was 18 years old, I had a third grade reading level. I have ADHD, I am very neuro typical. And ultimately... But it turned out that the only way my mom taught me how I learned and she literally, for example, she'd have me circle the five largest words in a paragraph. I could see words that were seven letters or longer and then she'd have me guess why those five words would be together. And that's how I learned how to read. But I could memorize the five words from the first paragraph to the last paragraph, and so I could turn through a book and very quickly get a very good understanding of what the book was about, but I can't read it like everybody else reads it in terms of small words and everything else.\n\n(01:12:37):\nBut ultimately what that did is that disability created super ability in me, which is questions. I know how to ask so many questions because that's the way I learn. And so at some point in time, my disability has caused me to have super abilities. That's why I think your weaknesses actually create your super abilities and knowing what they are is so important. And so this is where I think a lot of this comes from is to realize I was supposed to be a baggage handler or a construction worker.\n\n(01:13:03):\nAnd my mom basically told me is like, if you understand how you learn and what you do, you can do it, but you have to be careful because if you get labeled as dyslexic, you will be basically seen as special needs. And this is 19, when I got first labeled, I was put into special needs classes, which was a room at the end of the hall. You just sat in all day and didn't really learn anything because there was no real programs for any of it. So she taught me how to really school and learn my own way. And that's where I think I built my superpowers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:32):\nWow. I feel like I could do a whole episode deep dive into this. I just had Tobias Lütke on the podcast, the CEO of Shopify, he's also dyslexic. And we actually didn't get that.\n\nBob Moesta (01:13:44):\nThere's an amazing amount of entrepreneurs who are dyslexic. And I attribute it back to the fact it's because we couldn't get jobs. We just went to create our own thing because we had to figure out our own way to work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:58):\nYeah, that's a bittersweet feature maybe.\n\nBob Moesta (01:14:03):\nYeah. I think that... Whenever I meet somebody with a disability and they talk about the disability, I quickly go, \"What's your super ability?\" Tell me what it's because somebody who's blind can hear things that are just unbelievable. They can smell things. They can smell people walking in the room, just crazy, crazy stuff. And you start to realize, I know that you don't have sight, but the reality is it's actually affected you in another way. And what does that superpower and how do we actually leverage that superpower?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:31):\nOkay. I want to touch on two more things before I let you go that I think are going to be helpful to a lot of people. One is being a founder, the other is just getting into alignment with what you're doing in life. So from the perspective being a founder, you told me that people actually can use this framework we've been talking about to decide if they should even be founders. What is your advice there?\n\nBob Moesta (01:14:54):\nPart of it is to realize as a founder, you have to do a lot of different things. And so part of it is I think self-awareness is one of the biggest assets you're going to have. And to know what you you're good at, to know what you suck at, it's also going to tell you about the team. You need to build around you. And so to realize at some point, there's a lot of people who say they want to be a founder, but what I would tell you is when you start to realize what you're good at, what's your strengths, what do you suck at, what are your energy drains?\n\n(01:15:22):\nAnd then go talk to a couple of founders, you'll start to realize how to shape for you to be a founder and whether for you, you decided I'm on my own, I'm going to do this myself, and I can hire people on contracting, but I want no employees. And so you start to realize how do you want to shape this thing based on who you are? And you took the time to do that. But most people, they have this notion of being a founder, but they don't know what founder they want to be. And what I would tell you is that there are a whole bunch of different kinds of founders and that you should self awareness and knowing energy drivers and drains and the reason why you want to be a founder become paramount to actually your success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:02):\nAnd so the advice there is look at your energy drivers and drains and also talk to founders, the interview prototype interviews to understand what it actually is and make sure you actually want to be doing that.\n\nBob Moesta (01:16:13):\nBecause what's interesting is I would say, so I've done two startups in the last year, so this is my eighth, and ninth startup. And what I realized is if I had go back to when I did my first startup, I spent more time on the logo and the website and all these other things that literally both of them, neither one has a website yet. It doesn't matter, right? I'm building the product, I got to make it a short works. And so you start to realize, you just realize there's different things you need to do. And what happens is you confuse activity with productivity and you end up doing a lot of work that just doesn't matter and you're stressing yourself out for all the wrong reasons. And so part of it is getting to be self-aware of those kinds of things is really important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:53):\nSpeaking of being self-aware, last question is around getting back into alignment with yourself. You also tell me that people use this to deal with overwhelm and understanding and solve their career course.\n\nBob Moesta (01:17:05):\nI didn't build it for this reason, I didn't build it for this reason, but there was a point in November where I was just overwhelmed. I was literally like, come on, this is not what I want to do. This is, and there's just so many things pulling on me and pressing on me that I'm like, okay. And I like, you know what? I'm going to go take the test. So when job moves, there's some resources and there's a test you can take and it'll tell you which quest you're in. So it asks, you pushes and pulls and puts it together and then tells you the probability that you're in one of the four quests. And as I did it, I went through it and just said, this is where I'm at, this what's going on? This is what's pushing me, this what's pulling me, where should I go next?\n\n(01:17:46):\nAnd it says, you need to have realignment. So basically it was a realignment job and I realized, okay, what are the five things that are really pulling me out of alignment? It was like all these podcasts I had to do. I wasn't building product, I was promoting more. I was doing all these things that I had to figure out how to sell books to big companies, all this stuff that just isn't me. And I realized, screw it. I'm going to buy the books. I'm going to give them away. I'm going to do, I was able to actually look at that list and pull the things off my list and basically either not do them or delegate them to somebody else. And it was actually about me pulling myself back into alignment. So I actually had more energy, and to be honest, I woke up the next day, I was a young entrepreneur again.\n\n(01:18:28):\nAnd so it's this aspect of realizing why do I want to get out? Why do I want to take the next step? What is the next step? Well, then how do I frame the next step and take it? And so to be honest, I'm now using it as almost like a, not daily, but once a month I'll take it just to actually help me realize what's going on. And it's helped me stop the energy that's pulling me in one direction or another and helps me stay on track. And it's just a really cool tool to do that. And so I have a couple of colleagues who are doing it as well, and it just is interesting how they realize I'm not a very good delegator, but when I realized it affects my motivation this way, it's like all of a sudden I've become a way better delegator to say, these are the things that are just pulling me or are misaligning me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:10):\nWow, that is so funny. Okay, so I know you finished the book in November, so I imagine that was related to your role.\n\nBob Moesta (01:19:16):\nIt was all about the law to the book. And it's like my whole thing is that the book was done and it was like then the publisher put all this... They put so much pressure on you to do all these other things and they have no data to tell you how well the book's going to do or not going to do it. And I'm like, it's done. Just get it out there. And they're like, no, no, no. We got to presale. We got to do this. You got to do all this promotion. And I'm like, \"Thank God I had two other authors to help me with that load.\" But I mean, we had an article in HBR, had the idea cast, they were on Wall Street Journal. I don't know any of that stuff. I get intimidated by all that stuff. So it's like like, okay, you guys take that stuff. But still, I had to do a lot of different speaking. And I love to do this because I know the people, I know your audience, I know what to do, but talking about HR to HR people is scary to me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:11):\nI don't think they would be happy with what you've shared today necessarily.\n\nBob Moesta (01:20:14):\nYeah. I'm sure we're going to get some, just so you're clear, we're probably going to get some backlash from some of it as well. But again, I am looking at it as I am trying to make progress for the masses here and I think that the advice I'm trying to give should be able to help. It's not going to help everybody, but it should help a lot of people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:30):\nAnd I love that it helped you in your own struggle when you were about to launch this book. That's so awesome.\n\nBob Moesta (01:20:34):\nThat was a surprise. That was a little bonus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):\nUltimate dot pruning. And I know you also built a product and just to give you opportunity to plug this, there's a product that you are building launching that is this book as a product. Talk about that.\n\nBob Moesta (01:20:46):\nSo we're in the very early stages of it. We're doing some things where it's going to facilitate asking the questions, and then it's got some AI to help build and summarize your situation. It'll actually take and help summarize your energy drivers and drains, and then as you prototype, you'll provide feedback. It'll provide context back to that to basically help you pick the prototype or pick the area that you want to really focus on. And so we're in the midst of fleshing that out. It probably won't be ready until the fall, but the reality is we're in early stages of it. I've got probably a couple hundred people in data testing it out and just working through it, but at some point when it comes out, I'll make sure I reach back out and let you know where it is and you can attach it to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:26):\nOkay, got it. Before we get to where to buy the book and all these things, is there anything else, Bob, that you wanted to share or you think is valuable to leave us today?\n\nBob Moesta (01:21:34):\nNo, you hit it all. You're an amazing interview. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. At some point I felt like I might've fed them with a fire hose, so some people might have to listen to it twice. I talk too fast, I get excited, but I think we hit all the big spots. Thank you. Awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:48):\nThe ultimate compliment I get from people is I have to listen to this one on 1X speed.\n\nBob Moesta (01:21:53):\nYeah. I think I got that. I got that one when we did the one on jobs, speed done was like, yeah, I listened to most of it at one and a half. I had to listen to this one at one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:02):\nYep, too funny. Okay, and then where can folks find the book if they want to?\n\nBob Moesta (01:22:06):\nAmazon is where you... Amazon borders, all the big book retailers you can find it. It's called Job Moves:9 Steps for Making Progress in Your Career Yep. There we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:16):\nI got one here too.\n\nBob Moesta (01:22:17):\nAnd to be honest, my thing is you can also go to jobmoves.com and it has basically free resources to basically help you walk through the process, steps themselves. And so if you go to jobmoves.com, it'll, there's a test to tell you what Quest you're in. There's a form for doing the interviews. There's a form basically to help you with prototyping, et cetera.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:39):\nActually have Jobmoves.com, I was checking the book to make sure you had the right domain. That's a great domain.\n\nBob Moesta (01:22:43):\nWe did, we did. We worked hard. Well, to be honest, it was one of the reasons why we named the book the way it was because the domain was available.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:52):\nI think you had read, you were originally going to call this book, Hire Your Next Job or something like that.\n\nBob Moesta (01:22:56):\nYeah, yeah. Actually, if you go into my Dropbox and you look at it's called My Next Thing. It was really about helping people find their next thing. But in the end, the publisher had to have influence on it, of course. And so I think I'm happy with Job Moves. I think it's a good thing. What's interesting is we can't... Hiring your next job was very inside job Jobs-to-be-Done pun kind of thing. But the reality is you had to be inside Jobs-to-be-Done, to get the pun, so it didn't really make sense to other people outside it. So it is what is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:27):\nGo for that big tam.\n\nBob Moesta (01:23:28):\nYeah, I guess that's exactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:30):\nBob, this is incredible. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nBob Moesta (01:23:30):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:30):\nI think it's going to be helpful to a lot of people, so thank you.\n\nBob Moesta (01:23:36):\nThank you, Lenny. Thank you so much for your time. And if they want to reach out to me, please, LinkedIn is the best place to go. And what I would say is one favor I could ask your listeners is that I'm a very curious person and I love to solve struggling moments, and so I might regret saying this, but the reality is if you have a struggling moment that you've been struggling with for a long time and you have no solution to help you figure it out, drop me a line so I can actually start to accumulate some of these struggling moments to figure out where I should go next.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:04):\nThat's a very generous offer. What's the best way to reach out? You said on LinkedIn?\n\nBob Moesta (01:24:09):\nLinkedIn, and just LinkedIn messaging. I'll accept the invite, or you can do it in message. It doesn't matter. But LinkedIn is the best way. I get too many emails and I have a very specific process around how I manage LinkedIn. That's just very useful for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):\nOkay, awesome. I'm glad you answered the question I forgot to ask, which is how listeners can be useful to you. So thank you for doing that.\n\nBob Moesta (01:24:26):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):\nBob, thank you so much.\n\nBob Moesta (01:24:29):\nThanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:30):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:24:32):\nThank you so much for listening.
